# ForceUpdateAllSteam

# Why did I do this?
The script is made to force steam to instantly update any game once an update is available, instead of just scheduling it to a random time

# How to use
When you start the file for the first time it will ask you for your Steamapps location, which it then saves in a path file for future use. You will have to relaunch the skript again every time you get a new Game in Steam because it will not be set to force update.
